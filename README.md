# LazyPizza
This code is for when you have to feed people with pizzas. It goes well until the sudden realisation that you are unable to perform simple maths.
You panic because you dont know how to find how many slices each person should get. Until you realise that you have a code for this.
This code will figure out how many slices of pizzas each person will get, and the remaining slices left.
Beware, the code is very bored and has no entertainment.
Also don't use words, just use numbers. Error will occur
